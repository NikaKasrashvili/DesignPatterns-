#  "Composite" design pattern

The Composite Design Pattern is a structural pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

:zap: Imagine you have a company with employees. Each employee can be an individual employee or a group of employees (like a department). The Composite pattern lets you treat both individual employees and groups of employees in the same way. So, whether you're dealing with a single employee or a whole department, you can use the same methods to interact with them.

## :octocat: Usage 

Here are some usage examples of the Composite Design Pattern in various scenarios:

:pushpin: **File System Structure:** In a file system, both files and directories can contain files or other directories. The Composite pattern can be used to represent this structure.

:pushpin: **Graphic User Interface (GUI) Widgets:** In GUI development, you might have a complex UI element made up of smaller UI elements. The Composite pattern can be used to represent this hierarchy.

:pushpin: **Organization Hierarchy:** As mentioned earlier, in a company, you can have individual employees or groups of employees (like departments). The Composite pattern can represent this hierarchy.


## :fire: Implementation 

Steps to Implement the Bridge Design Pattern:

- **Step 1:**  _**Identify the Component Interface:**_ Define an interface that declares the common operations for both leaf objects (individual elements) and composite objects (containers of elements) - _like IEmployee_.

- **Step 2:** _**Implement Leaf Class(es)**_: Create one or more classes that implement the Component interface. These classes represent individual elements (leaf nodes) in the composite structure (_like "IndividualEmployee"_).

- **Step 3:** _**Implement Composite Class(es)**_: Create one or more classes that implement the Component interface. These classes represent containers or composite objects that can contain leaf objects and/or other composite objects (_like "Department"_).

- **Step 4:** _Define Operations:_ Define operations in the composite class(es) to add, remove, or access child components (leaf or composite) as needed.

- **Step 5**: _Implement Operations:_ Implement the operations defined in step 4 for both leaf and composite classes. Leaf classes may have simpler implementations, while composite classes may need to delegate operations to their child components.

- **Step 6**: _Use the Composite Pattern:_ Create instances of leaf and composite classes as needed. Use the composite objects to build a hierarchical structure of elements.
